This capstone project course will  gives a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. There's assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.

## üèÅ Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX‚Äôs accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this capstone, the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company IS ASSUMED. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. The job is to determine the price of each launch. It's to be done by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for the said team. It's also to be determined if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, to be trained in here a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
